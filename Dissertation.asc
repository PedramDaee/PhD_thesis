\section*{Publication\ I: {\AaltoSeriesContributionTitle}}
{The author had the main responsiblity in problem formulation and modeling. The author designed and implemented the simulation experiment. Joel Pyykk\"o and the author built the system for user studies and conducted them together. The author wrote the initial draft of the manuscript, after which all co-authors joined for revisions.}

\section*{Publication\ II: {\AaltoSeriesContributionTitle}}
{The ideas and experiments in this article were designed jointly (the first three authors contributed equally). The author had the main responsibility in the derivation of the sequential experimental design and implementation of the experiments. Dr. Tomi Peltola derived and implemented the posterior approximation. The manuscript was written jointly.}
